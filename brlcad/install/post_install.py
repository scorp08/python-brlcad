"""
The post_install script is the the beating heart of python-brlcad. After
setuptools runs the default install command, it runs the entrypoint ``main``
which generates the python/BRL-CAD bindings.

This needs to be a post-install script because on most python installations,
the setup script is executed with elevated permissons. After installation, such
as during the first run, the script has less than elevated permissions and
can't insert generated files into the installed location. So that's why this is
a part of the setuptools install process.
